## Hi there 👋

I'll fill this in with widgets and geegaws later, I'm sure. This is my primary GitHub account. I also control @todb-r7, but that will likely fade into history.

## Contact

  - 🐘 [@todb@infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@todb) is my main Mastodon account (Here's my [intro](https://infosec.exchange/@todb/109270457002321619).)
  - 💬 *5 won 2 dash 4 3 ate hyphen 9 uno six 5* is my Signal number. Works for Signal Voice too.
  - ☎️ The above is also my phone number, but I don't often answer it, with the help of [RoboKiller](https://www.robokiller.com/)
  - 🔐 I hate PGP, but still kinda like [Keybase](https://keybase.io/todb).
  - 📧 My most reliable email right now is a toss up between todb@packetfu.com and todb@hugesuccess.org.
  - 😱 I'm [741343407133425726](https://discordapp.com/users/741343407133425726) on Discord, and Discord is a surprisingly effective way to reach me quickly.
  - 🤑 I'm on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/todbeardsley/), and trying to be more active there, but I'm afraid it's mostly lashing out at toxic positivity people and the work-from-office cultists. 

## GitHub

As of Q2 of 2023, I appear to be the 17th most prolific committer to the [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/graphs/contributors). Woo-hoo! Here are some more recent GitHub stats, which I imagine are pretty pathetic right now.
